\title{Groupwise Rail Plot}
\usage{
Groupwiserail(data, id, x, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the dataframe holding your data}

\item{id}{your grouping variable}

\item{x}{X axis nutrient (will be labelled on an energy (kCal) basis)}

\item{y}{Y axis nutrient (will be labelled on an energy (kCal) basis)}
}
\value{
A complete plot demonstrating the intake rail for EACH GROUP (see Railfunction for total dataset). The groups intake ratio will be printed close to the cluster, and identified through the group ID. Bear with me, it's a work in progress!
}
\description{
This function generates a rail plot demonstrating the nutrient balance of foods. It then plots the nutrient rails (intake rails) for each group delineated in your data set 
All you need to do is input 2 nutrients and a grouping variable, and voila!
